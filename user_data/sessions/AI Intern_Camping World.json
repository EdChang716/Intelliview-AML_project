How did you approach the situation, what steps did you take to clarify your understanding, and what was the outcome of your efforts?",
      "user_answer": "Okay, so I was in an applied machine learning class and we were asked to do a project about anything regarding as long as it is related to artificial intelligence and we use one kind of machine learning algorithms. So at the beginning we were pretty confused because we don't know we don't know exactly where to start. So several we the steps we decided to do is to first have a review of what we have learned over the semester and then we also ask professors about what you mean and what the rubrics is and then take a look at it and several times and then we realized that maybe the professor he wanted us to think about what we can possibly learn from the cutting edge technology and what is the innovation that we can gain from the machine learning usage application and the usage and from this we decided to build an application that no one has ever come and it become really successful.",
